## Table-Tracker

The team project at Northcoders.


Table Tracker is an application designed for restaurants to keep track of the order journey from placing an order, preparation in the kitchen, to serving the order. 
The tables are tracked by their colour which will be shown to all staff members so they are notified on the table status.
The restaurant admins can add their own food to the menu and also add staff access to restrict the view of certain employees.
Tech used: JavaScript || React || Firebase Authentication || Node js || PSQL || Axios || Sass || Context API || Express
